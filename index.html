        Ghouls live among us, the same as normal people in every way--except their craving for human flesh.
        Ken Kaneki is an ordinary college student  until a violent encounter turns him into the first half-human
        half-ghoul hybrid. Trapped between two worlds, he must survive Ghoul turf wars, learn more about Ghoul society 
        and master his new powers. Shy Ken Kaneki is thrilled to go on a date with the beautiful Rize.But it turns 
        out that she's only  interested in his body-eating it, that is.When a morally questionable rescue transforms 
        him into the first half-human half-Ghoul hybrid, Ken is drawn into the dark and violent world of Ghouls,which 
        exists alongside our own.
